# Informative-Cluster-Size
Test for informative cluster size with clustered survival data allowing for right censoring.

We provide the function in R (Zstat_fun.R) with support of Rcpp (Z_stat_fun_cpp.cpp) to test for Informative Cluster Suze (ICS).
An example of how to use the test function is provided for two applications in Example.R. 

Supplementary material for the paper "Test for informative cluster size with right censored survival data" by Alessandra Meddis and Aur√©lien Latouche is also provided.
